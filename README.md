## Topic
This project analyzes data from the Davis Labor Day Running Races to explore factors affecting running endurance, focusing on age, gender, race distance, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Methodology
Using Python's BeautifulSoup and requests libraries, race data (names, ages, finish times, gender, race type, and year) were scraped from the official website. Data was processed with pandas and visualized using plotly.express. The analysis examined speed and pace differences by age and gender, as well as pre- and post-pandemic performance.

## Tools
- Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, requests
- Data Processing: pandas
- Visualization: plotly.express
- Storage: CSV format

## Results
- Age Group Performance: The 10-19 age group had the highest speed (10.65 Km/h), while >90 had the lowest (6.40 Km/h).
- Gender Differences: Males generally had higher speeds.
- Pandemic Impact: Post-pandemic performance showed slight changes, with younger groups (e.g., 10-19) seeing a decline in speed.
